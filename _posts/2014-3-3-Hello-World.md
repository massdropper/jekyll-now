# Problem
With the rise of digital billboards, advertising companies like Lamar Advertising have a huge opportunity to increase their profit margins.  Their current pricing model takes into account things like time of day, time of year, and station.  However, there's public data available to make their pricing model much more granular.  Taking advantage of this data would allow advertising companies to take full advantage peak pricing hours and lower barriers of entry for smaller companies that want to purchase ads.

# Analysis

By looking into transit data from the MTA, we pulled the top 5 Stations by number of total impressions for a given weekday.  However, this shows information that advertising companies already know.  Our next graphic highlights the benefits they'd see if they switched to a per hour pricing model based on number of impressions.

By looking at MTA data, we see that there is a lot of variability between stations.  Advertising companies already know that weekdays experience two main peak periods.  However, the graph shows that not all peak periods are the same across stations.  Some peak periods last longer than others.  Some start later and end later.  If you look at the purple line representing Canal St, you'll see that they have an initial peak period, but no major subsequent dip that's exhibited by the other stations.  It's all of these irregularities that advertising companies can capitalize on to increase profits.
